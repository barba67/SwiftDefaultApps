# SwiftDefaultApps

This upcoming app is chiefly intended to be a modern replacement for the amazing RCDefaultApp developed way back when by Carl Lindberg, which stopped working in 10.12 due to deprecation of ObjC Garbage collection. Additionally, I guess it's a good way to teach myself Swift.
Feel free to contribute or comment.

I'm using https://github.com/jakeheis/SwiftCLI as a base for the CLI.
